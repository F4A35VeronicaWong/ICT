	<article><p> My name is Veronica Wong. I am almost 15 years old. </p>
	<p>I am a Form 4 student of Sacred Heart Canossian College (English Section). </p>
	<p>I have joined a few charity associations because I like to take up voluntary work. I usually help them with activities on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays.</p>
	<p> I am a “Guia Juvenil de Combate ao Crime” member of the Judiciary Police Department.</p> 
	<p>Our team has to promote positive attitude towards life and to help the teenagers to acknowledge the importance of good discipline.</p>
	<p>We will do our best to prevent crimes.</p> 
	<p>I have quite a busy life because I have also taken piano, horn, dancing, badminton, Portuguese and Mathematics Courses.</p> 
	<p>Although I have a very tight schedule, I can still cater for my studies.</p></article>
